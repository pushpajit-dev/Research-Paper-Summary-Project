# **Assignment | Summarising and Analysing Research Papers**

## Platform - Skillible.io
## **Overview**
### In this enhanced project, you will not only summarize research papers but also analyze and extract key insights. This involves generating concise summaries, identifying significant findings, and suggesting potential applications or implications of the research. The goal is to practice and refine your ability to create effective prompts, analyze information, and apply insights.
## **Objectives**
###
    - Understand and apply prompt engineering techniques.
    - Generate accurate and concise summaries of research papers.
    - Analyze research findings to extract key insights.
    - Suggest potential applications or implications of the research.
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of different prompts.
    - Reflect on the learning experience and improve your prompting and analytical skills.
## **Instructions**
### 
    - Select a Topic: Choose one of the provided topics that align with your field of interest.
    - Find a Research Paper: Locate a research paper related to your chosen topic. This can be from academic journals, conference proceedings, or reputable online sources.
    - Generate Summaries: Create prompts to generate summaries of the research paper. Start with an initial prompt and iterate to refine the output.
    - Analyze Findings: Use prompts to identify and extract key insights from the research paper.
    - Suggest Applications: Use prompts to suggest potential applications or implications of the research findings.
    - Evaluate Summaries and Insights: Assess the generated summaries and insights based on clarity, accuracy, and relevance.
    - Reflect and Document: Reflect on your experience, document the prompts used, the generated summaries, insights, and your evaluation.
