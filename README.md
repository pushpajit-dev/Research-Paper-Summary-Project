## **Initial Prompt**
### **Description (50 words max):** 
To generate a summary of the document, the initial prompt instructs Chat GPT to analyse the provided research and extract key findings on social media's impact on mental health. Focus on both positive and negative effects, demographic variations, and research methodologies used in the studies. Used Attach File Option. 
### **Generated Summary (100 words max):** 
On one hand, it is a platform for mental health awareness and peer support, fostering community and communication. On the other hand, increased and prolonged use is associated with negative psychological outcomes, such as depression and anxiety. These effects are particularly pronounced among certain demographic groups like women and non-Hispanic whites. The methodology includes empirical studies and statistical analyses, providing robust evidence of these impacts.

### **Iteration 1**
### **Description (50 words max):** 
Analyse the research on social media's mental health impacts. Summarize effects and describe strategies to mitigate negatives, promoting balanced use. Include recommendations for safe social media usage for children of different ages, offering practical tips for parents and educators to help children develop healthy online habits.
### **Generated Summary (100 words max):**
To mitigate these negative effects and promote balanced social media use, individuals should set time limits for daily usage, engage in offline activities, and practice digital detoxes regularly. Parents and educators can play a crucial role by setting boundaries for children's social media use, encouraging face-to-face interactions, and monitoring online activities. Specific recommendations for children include using privacy settings, avoiding exposure to harmful content, and having open conversations about online experiences. By adopting these strategies, the negative impacts of social media can be minimized, allowing individuals, to use these platforms in a healthy and balanced manner.
### **Iteration 2**
### **Description (50 words max):**
Examine the quasi-experimental findings on social media’s impact on mental health among U.S. college students. Assess how Social-Media’s introduction correlated with increased depression symptoms, mental health service use, and academic impairments. Analyse the role of unfavourable social comparisons as a mechanism and consider implications for future social media policies.
### **Generated Summary (100 words max):**
The study explores the impact of Social Media’s introduction on U.S. college students’ mental health using a quasi-experimental approach. Findings reveal that Facebook's roll-out is linked to increased depression symptoms and greater use of mental health services, particularly among vulnerable students. Additionally, students experienced more academic impairments.
### **Final Prompt**
> ### **Description (50 words max):**
Examine how social media affects adolescent mental health, particularly in relation to substance abuse, body image issues, eating disorders, and cyberbullying.

### **Reflection**
> ### **(250 words max):**
Engaging with the generative AI course from Skillible presented several significant challenges that enriched my learning experience. One of the main obstacles was understanding the complex algorithms and technical principles behind AI technologies. Concepts such as neural networks and natural language processing were initially daunting, requiring a substantial effort to grasp fully.
Additionally, the assignment of summarizing detailed topics tested my ability to condense extensive information into clear, concise summaries. Balancing the need to capture essential details while maintaining brevity was a demanding task that sharpened my skills in prioritizing and synthesizing information effectively.
Through these challenges, I learned valuable lessons about both generative AI and the craft of summarization. I gained a deeper understanding of how AI can be applied across various fields, including content creation and data analysis, and developed a clearer appreciation for the ethical considerations in AI development. The assignment improved my ability to analyse and distil complex information, enhancing my communication skills.
Overall, the course and its assignments provided a profound learning experience. They not only deepened my knowledge of generative AI but also honed my ability to convey complex topics succinctly. The process underscored the importance of clear and precise communication and has equipped me with skills that are beneficial for both academic and professional contexts. The challenges faced have ultimately contributed to a more comprehensive and practical understanding of AI and its applications.
